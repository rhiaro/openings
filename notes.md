OPENINGS

Windows to another place, where the technology is there on the other side as well. Like a video call, but reality. Objects can pass through, but living things cannot.

The premise: A group who are like a food truck but via openings. They open all over and see loads of interesting places from their little window, and serve tasty treats.

A small planetary system with several close together planets. Multiple species evolved and have now mingled all over.

There's a community of humans, small. A group were abducted centuries ago and left here. Earth is too far to travel now. Perhaps they're the only non-native species to this solar system.

The youth are getting portable openings. So they can communicate and pass small things around. Kind of a fad, but growing in popularity. Some people think it's dangerous.

One person in the shop has some sort of dark, espionagy history. Another is a human.

In the background, in the news... an opening was sent to Earth decades ago. Soon arriving. Mixed reactions among humans.

One/some/most species using im/ir pronouns. Play with all kinds of [alien] expression of gender... or lack thereof. Even the humans. Especially the humans.

A plant-like lifeform is fixed in place and communicates using scent/pheremones. 

Something like a lone oankali always shifting shape and seeking a pod of mates.

Aïllle - someone who is a species which has a normal body, matures, deposits some kind of egg, then turns into a particle/spore cloud and seeks someone else's eggs to fertilise. Many other species see the evaporation stages as death as they are no longer able to interact with the individual, but the beings actually live forever as part of a shared consciousness with the universe or whatever.
One works in the food opening.
The cloud form can pass through openings.
Aïllle asks a favour... to open somewhere that allows someone they know to pass through and out to another world where there are few others or something.
Later Aïllle evaporates.. it's a big emotional deal for the rest of the gang.

Species that mature into m or f equivs depending on who they are exposed to in childhood. It's complicated in a multi-species society and now they can actively choose to take specific hormones (equiv) if they want.

fs are big, have pouches like kangaroos. ms are small.
To reproduce, f takes m into the pouch for months-years. They bond physiologically and combine genetic material to create offspring. An m works in the food opening, but goes on 'parental leave'. The f - Millisen - comes to visit sometimes. It's dangerous for m if process is interupted/they are forcibly removed. f has 4 arms, 2 occupied holding the pouch when m is inside.
