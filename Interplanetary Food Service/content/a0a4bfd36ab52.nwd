# Kein

A cybernetically modified GHUO from the Signori Asteroid Belt.

Has a robotic third arm and hand emerging from the center of their back.

They are quite obtuse and rude, with a bit of a superiority complex, and dismissive of other peoples problems. This is probably why they ended up leaving Signori.
