# The Twist

A giant space station on the edge of the solar system, just past Signori. Shaped like a giant twisty shape. Orbited by a field of pinhole Openings, so people can spectate launches.

The headquarters of Marshat Luwas.

Where most Openings are produced.

Home to hundreds of thousands of people, contributors and their families.
